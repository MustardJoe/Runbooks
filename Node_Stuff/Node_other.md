Master Install and Activate Latest Node Version
  not sure why i need this command, something to do with some setting Ryan had us tweak on our machines that "lets us choose which node version" but actually just locks us to an old build - anyway, this command forces the lastest version of node to download and be selected as the active node version:
  <b> "sudo n latest" </b>
