This folder contains ESLint linting files for various applications/uses.

Currently it just had the Alchemy-FE-BE linting file Ryan assembled, which is a very good JS linting file.

# Setting Up ESLint in a Project
run the following command:
```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

then run:
```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
```

this will walk you through basic configuration and get the linter running for your JS files in your project.
