A big different between JavaScript and Python is that JavaScript automatically scopes all packages that modify the base JavaScript code to the context of the single runing instance of JS app. Python doesn't do this automatically, and so Python projects that use other packages need to be individualy provisioned for by setting up Virtual Environments.

Virtual Environments are local instances of Python that have been (or can bee) slightly modified from core Python through the installation of 3rd party packages and PIP modules, etc.

Instructions on configuring Virtual Envs to follow.
